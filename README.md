AndMaps
=======

This is the project I developed (in a 2-person team) for my Bachelor's Thesis. 
It consists of an Android application that shows on a map (Google Maps) location of particular interest. 

The user is able to find particular places around him, save favourites, filter the categories of locations he is searching and calculate the best path.
Locations are taken from an online database and contain information about the activity, opening hours and other useful information.
